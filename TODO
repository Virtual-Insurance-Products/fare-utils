TODO
* document what works and what doesn't
* document all those functions, classes, etc., that do work.
* export all the symbols correctly.
* import trie from pangram thingie

* DECLAIM - distributed execution of common-lisp agents with intent and mobility

* move stateful datastructures to a stateful: package.
  Question: should I use separate interfaces as in the pure: package,
  or dispatch directly on objects as in usual OO style?

* have generic state-passing updaters in the style of setf.
  (updatef (lookup i m k) v) ==>  ((update-expander lookup) v i m k) ==> (insert i m k v)
